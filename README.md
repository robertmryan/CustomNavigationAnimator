## CustomPushNavigation

This is an demonstration of custom transitions in conjunction with `UINavigationController`. Specifically, this demonstrates the use of custom interactive push transition (e.g. allow swipe from right edge to interactively "push" to predetermined view controller).

This was developed in Swift on Xcode 10.1 for iOS 12.1. But, the basic ideas are equally applicable for different versions of Xcode and iOS versions.
